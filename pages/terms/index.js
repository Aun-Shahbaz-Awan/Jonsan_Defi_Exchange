      The Company has developed Oasis an online, decentralized and autonomous
      environment that displays price information and autonomous smart contract
      mechanisms of digital tokens and assets (“Digital Assets”) and provides
      the user-interface that guides your access to Oasis; the Site is used to
      provide Users with access to certain decentralized finance services and
      products on the Ethereum blockchain through Oasis (the “Services.”) The
      Services may require users to pay fees, such as gas charges on the
      Ethereum network, to perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that
      the Company has no control over User transactions, User digital assets,
      the method or amount of payment required for any User to engage in any
      transaction, or any payments of fees for any transactions. You must ensure
      that you have a sufficient balance to complete any transaction using the
      Site or Services before initiating such transaction. User affirms that the
      User is aware and acknowledges that Company is a noncustodial provider of
      software services, meaning that the Company does not custody, control, or
      manage User funds in any manner whatsoever. The Services are deployed in a
      decentralized environment wherein the Services can be autonomously and
      directly accessed by the Users without any involvement or actions taken by
      Company or any third-party.
